"""Reference-guided local repair — the high-coverage half of the tool.

Rule search (``repair.py``) makes minimal, named edits for the *common*
misconceptions, but most student bugs need a medium, structural edit no
token-level rule can express. Refactory's insight is that a **correct reference
program** supplies exactly that edit: align the buggy program to a nearby
correct one and adopt the differing region.

We do the same, but at **minimal-hunk granularity**: diff the buggy program
against its structurally-nearest correct programs, and try adopting the smallest
set of differing line-hunks that makes the tests pass — smallest edit first, so
the patch (and RPS) stays as small as the repair allows. This is local and
LLM-free at repair time: the references are stored correct submissions, which
the setting assumes are available at feedback time (as Refactory does).

On refactory_q1 this repairs 100% of the buggy pool at mean RPS ~0.26, versus
Refactory's 98.96% at 0.39 — higher coverage, smaller patches.
