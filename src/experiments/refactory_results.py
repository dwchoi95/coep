"""Collect the Refactory tool's CSVs into the agreed unified format:

    results/<ver>/<p_id>/refactory.csv   one row per buggy submission
    results/<ver>/<p_id>/summary.csv     upserted (Approach=Refactory, Model=none)

Source is ``reference`` on success (Refactory's mechanism *is* reference
reuse) and ``none`` otherwise; submissions the adapter could not export are
rows with Fixed=False (shared full denominator). Refactory has no LLM columns
(ATT_api/InT/OuT/$API/$Build = 0) and no rules.

Submissions that already pass the full suite are excluded, matching what the
CoEP and PyDex runners do. They are not bugs, and counting them would inflate
whichever arm's denominator happened to include them -- on cf_125A it was the
difference between N=38 here and N=37 there, and a rate is not comparable
across two denominators.

RPS is recomputed from the returned patch rather than read from their CSV.
Refactory rewrites each program into ``def main(): try: <body> except _Exit:
pass`` and reformats it, and reports RPS between the *wrapped* buggy program
and the *wrapped* repair. That is a fair measure of its own edit, but not the
same quantity we compute for the other arms, and the wrapper inflates the
denominator, so the reported value runs low: on cf_125A theirs averages 0.523
where the same patches measured on the same footing as every other arm average
0.606. We strip the scaffold and measure against the student's original
program, which is what CoEP and PyDex are measured against.

Usage: python3 -m src.experiments.refactory_results cf_125A [cf_110A ...]
