"""Enter Refactory's published numbers (its own corpus) into the unified
summary CSVs, per protocol: on refactory_q1..q5 we do not re-run the tool --
RR/RPS/ATT come verbatim from the paper's strongest configuration
(per-problem times 3.5/4.8/4.7/8.7/13.1 s; overall 5.5 s). Quoting the authors
on their own corpus leaves no room to argue we configured their tool wrongly.

``refactory_results`` can also collect the authors' shipped run of the tool and
re-measure it on our footing; that output is archived at
``results/v2/_refactory_ours.json`` and reproduces these published repair rates
to 0.05 points corpus-wide, but it is not what the paper reports.

Usage: python3 -m src.experiments.refactory_published
